# automation-exercise

In order to run the automated test:  
1- open cmd line from the root location folder of the js files.  
2- npm install puppeteer fs path --save  
3- do node form_fill.js or node form_fill_change_Employees.js and press enter  

For form_fill.js I have setup the test as headless( it will not open the browser) while for the second file it will open the browser and you can see all the steps being performed.
